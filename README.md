# Movies-ETL
## Overview of the project
Amazing Prime,a movie streaming service want us to create an automated pipeline that takes in new data, performs the appropriate transformations, and loads the data from the three files—Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and the MovieLens rating data—and performs the ETL process by adding the data to a PostgreSQL database.In oreder to create the pipeline,we follow this ETL process: extract the Wikipedia and Kaggle data from their respective files, transform the datasets by cleaning them up and joining them together, and load the cleaned dataset into a SQL database.At the end,they organized a hackathon.
